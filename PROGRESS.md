# MCP Dart SDK Implementation Progress

## Completed

### Project Setup
- [x] Created package scaffold
- [x] Added dependencies in pubspec.yaml
- [x] Created main library file
- [x] Set up analysis options

### Core Protocol
- [x] Implemented JSON-RPC message types
- [x] Implemented base types and enums
- [x] Implemented session lifecycle management
- [x] Implemented base session handling
- [x] Implemented exceptions
- [x] Implemented utilities
- [x] Implemented version information
- [x] Implemented request context handling

### Client Implementation
- [x] Implemented client session
- [x] Implemented main client class
- [x] Implemented StdioTransport
- [x] Implemented HttpSseTransport
- [x] Implemented WebSocketTransport

### Client Capabilities Implementation
- [x] Implement roots capability
- [x] Implement sampling capability

### Server Implementation
- [x] Implement server session
- [x] Implement main server class
- [x] Implement StdioTransport for server
- [x] Implement HttpSseTransport for server
- [x] Implement WebSocketTransport for server

### Documentation
- [x] Created README with examples
- [x] Added API documentation to core classes

### Examples
- [x] Created client example
- [x] Created in-memory example with simple server implementation
- [x] Created server example

### Testing
- [x] Created client tests
- [x] Created capability tests

## In Progress

### Server Capabilities Implementation
- [ ] Implement resources capability
- [ ] Implement tools capability
- [ ] Implement prompts capability
- [ ] Implement logging capability

### Protocol Utilities
- [ ] Implement ping functionality
- [ ] Implement request cancellation
- [ ] Implement progress tracking
- [ ] Implement pagination
- [ ] Implement completion utilities

### Testing
- [ ] Create server tests
- [ ] Create integration tests
- [ ] Create transport tests

### Examples
- [ ] Create Flutter integration example

## Next Steps
1. Implement server capabilities (resources, tools, prompts, logging)
2. Implement protocol utilities
3. Add comprehensive tests
4. Create more examples
5. Generate JSON serialization code

## Known Issues
- Missing build_runner generated code (types.g.dart, json_rpc.g.dart, etc.)
- WebSocket and HTTP+SSE transports need integration testing
- Need to test against actual MCP servers

## Dependencies to Install
Before running code generation and tests, you need to install:
- Dart SDK (or Flutter SDK which includes Dart)
- build_runner package
