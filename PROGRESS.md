# MCP Dart SDK Implementation Progress

## Completed

### Project Setup
- [x] Created package scaffold
- [x] Added dependencies in pubspec.yaml
- [x] Created main library file
- [x] Set up analysis options

### Core Protocol
- [x] Implemented JSON-RPC message types
- [x] Implemented base types and enums
- [x] Implemented session lifecycle management
- [x] Implemented base session handling
- [x] Implemented exceptions
- [x] Implemented utilities
- [x] Implemented version information
- [x] Implemented request context handling

### Client Implementation
- [x] Implemented client session
- [x] Implemented main client class
- [x] Implemented StdioTransport
- [x] Implemented HttpSseTransport
- [x] Implemented WebSocketTransport

### Documentation
- [x] Created README with examples
- [x] Added API documentation to core classes

### Examples
- [x] Created client example

### Testing
- [x] Created client tests

## In Progress

### Client Capabilities Implementation
- [ ] Implement roots capability
- [ ] Implement sampling capability

### Server Implementation
- [ ] Implement server session
- [ ] Implement main server class
- [ ] Implement StdioTransport for server
- [ ] Implement HttpSseTransport for server
- [ ] Implement WebSocketTransport for server

### Server Capabilities Implementation
- [ ] Implement resources capability
- [ ] Implement tools capability
- [ ] Implement prompts capability
- [ ] Implement logging capability

### Protocol Utilities
- [ ] Implement ping functionality
- [ ] Implement request cancellation
- [ ] Implement progress tracking
- [ ] Implement pagination
- [ ] Implement completion utilities

### Testing
- [ ] Create server tests
- [ ] Create integration tests
- [ ] Create transport tests
- [ ] Create capability tests

### Examples
- [ ] Create server example
- [ ] Create Flutter integration example

## Next Steps
1. Implement client capabilities (roots, sampling)
2. Implement server session and main server class
3. Implement server capabilities (resources, tools, prompts, logging)
4. Implement protocol utilities
5. Add comprehensive tests
6. Create more examples
7. Generate JSON serialization code

## Known Issues
- Missing build_runner generated code (types.g.dart, json_rpc.g.dart, etc.)
- WebSocket and HTTP+SSE transports need integration testing
- Need to test against actual MCP servers

## Dependencies to Install
Before running code generation and tests, you need to install:
- Dart SDK (or Flutter SDK which includes Dart)
- build_runner package
